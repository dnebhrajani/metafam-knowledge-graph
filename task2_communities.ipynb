    "# Task 2: Community Detection and Family Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this task is detecting family units and communities in the MetaFam knowledge graph using graph clustering algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach and its expected outcomes are detailed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach:\n",
    "1. Apply two community detection algorithms: Louvain (modularity optimization) and Label Propagation (semi-supervised)\n",
    "2. Evaluate quality using modularity, coverage, and conductance metrics\n",
    "3. Compare detected communities with actual family structures (50 connected components)\n",
    "4. Analyze generations within communities and identify bridge individuals\n",
    "5. Propose a relatedness metric combining path distance, community membership, and shared ancestry\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Outcomes:\n",
    "- Identify natural family clusters beyond simple connected components\n",
    "- Detect sub-families within large extended families\n",
    "- Find individuals who bridge different family groups\n",
    "- Create a quantitative measure of family relatedness"

    "## Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "For community detection, the directed knowledge graph was converted into an undirected, unweighted graph. This aids the capture of structural family connectivity rather than relationship semantics. Directionality and relation types are intentionally collapsed since community detection algorithms assume symmetric links and family membership is inherently mutual, regardless of the nature of the relation. Semantic information such as relationship types and generations is reintroduced later during analysis, allowing a clean separation between structure-based clustering and semantic validation."

    "### Intra-Family Community Detection Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has 50 disconnected family trees. Traditional community detection algorithms (Louvain, Label Propagation) applied to the whole graph simply rediscover these 50 connected components, providing no insight into family sub-structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we applied community detection *within* each connected component using Louvain algorithm with resolution parameter tuning to reveal meaningful family sub-structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results**:\n",
    "1. Sub-communities detected: 159 sub-communities across 50 families (avg size 8.3 members)\n",
    "2. Community composition:\n",
    "   - 92 multi-generational communities: (spanning 3+ generations) (the dominant pattern)\n",
    "   - 4 nuclear families: (2 generations, high parent-child relationships)\n",
    "   - 0 sibling cohorts: siblings are connected by edges, but Louvain groups them with their parents/children into multi-generational units rather than isolating them\n",
    "   - 63 other (mixed relationship patterns)\n",
    "3. Resolution parameter sensitivity: Resolution=1.0 produces meaningful family-sized units (avg 8 members), higher values (2.0+) fragment into singletons\n",
    "4. Generation span: Most communities span 1-4 generations, with multi-generational extended families being the norm\n",

This hierarchical approach is essential for genealogical knowledge graphs, exposing lineage branches and sub-family structures invisible to whole-graph community detection."
